# Sorting-Algorithms
Bubble Sort Algorithm: Checks 2 index at a time and if the second index is smaller than the first, they swap. If not, they don't swap. 
Insertion Sort Algorithm: Checks the first index in an array and then scans the next index and compares ,If the second index is smaller they swap and goes to the left,then the greater element checks the next element if its lesser then swaps and then the swapped lesser element compares to the left index. If smaller they swap and so on.
Selection Sort Algorithm: Selects th first index and iterates it then goes on to check all the other elements and finds the smaller element and iterates it if it finds another smaller element it iterates it and remove the second iterated element. If there's no other smaller element, the iterated element swaps with the first index.
